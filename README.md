# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python repository! This space serves as a digital journal of my coding progress, featuring everything from my first lines of code to functional mini-projects.
This is a comprehensive collection of Python fundamentals, logic-building assignments, and hands-on mini-projects developed from core chapters and applications.

## What's Inside?

 Based on my learning roadmap, this repository is organized into the following sections:

* **CHAPTER_0to7**: Core foundations including syntax, loops, and data types.
* **CHAPTER8 & CHAPTER9**: Intermediate concepts and deeper dives into Python's capabilities.
* **Assignments**: Challenging exercises to test logic and problem-solving.
* **miniProjects in python**: Small, independent scripts built to solve specific tasks.
* **PYTHON PROJECTS while lectures**: Hands-on projects built in real-time during my learning sessions.

## Skills Developed
* **Logic Building:** Solving structured assignments to master algorithmic thinking.
* **Application:** Turning theory into practice through mini-projects.
* **Structure:** Learning to organize code and assets within a professional workflow.
