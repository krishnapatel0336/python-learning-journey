Object oriented programming
#programming style

classes
objects
attributes
methods

Makes code-
@ reusable
@organise
@easy to maintain
similar to real world objects

#staticmethod do not use self they are use for
utility level function


OOPs Concepts:


#encaptulation
Wrap data + methods inside single unit(class).

#abstraction:   conclusion
show only essential details and hide the complexity
Eg:Instagram we use without knowing backend


#polymorphism:
same function name but diffrent behavior and classes 
one function -> many behaviors depends on objects calling it
(same method used)

#inheritance:   Heridity (jaydat)
parent class and child class    (parent)
perents method is usable ny childe class
